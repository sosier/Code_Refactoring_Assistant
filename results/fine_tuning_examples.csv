 - Respond with only the code block
 - Don't explain the changes made
 - If you use any packages (e.g. `os`, `re`, `sys`), don't forget to import them

Again, do not change the name of the function in any way!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```python
# Write a function to find the minimum total path sum in the given triangle.
def min_sum_path(A): 
	memo = [None] * len(A) 
	n = len(A) - 1
	for i in range(len(A[n])): 
		memo[i] = A[n][i] 
	for i in range(len(A) - 2, -1,-1): 
		for j in range( len(A[i])): 
			memo[j] = A[i][j] + min(memo[j], 
									memo[j + 1]) 
	return memo[0]
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

```python
def min_sum_path(triangle):
    n = len(triangle)
    dp = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(i+1):
            if i == n-1:
                dp[j] = triangle[i][j]
            else:
                dp[j] = triangle[i][j] + min(dp[j], dp[j+1])
    
    return dp[0]
```<|eot_id|>"
